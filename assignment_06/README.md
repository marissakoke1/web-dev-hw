## Assignment 6
### Marissa Koke
1. Forms I usually come across on the web are polls. They serve the purpose of obtaining outside information from people all over to help with data.
2. An example of a text is a plain text using the < p >.  This allows you to put a plain text inside the body. A selection is radio button that allows you select one item. A button input is an upload button. This would allow the user to upload different types of files.
3. The work cycle for this assignment was enjoyable. The thing that I didn't like was the colums. Having to add a new < tr > every time you wanted a new colum is a hassle. Other than that I enjoyed making this mini form page.
