Browsers function by the user interface that lets users interact, a render engine that makes up what the page looks like from html and css, browser engine directs the actions between the render engine and the user interface, it communicates over the network, javascript interpreter helps translate javascript, and data storage is composed of cookies and the local storage. The only browser I use is Microsoft Edge.
