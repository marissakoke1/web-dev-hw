1. The head can have 5 different elements. The meta, viewport, title, link, and style. The body has two. The structural markup and the semantic markup.
2. Structural markup is what embeds information like the heading, paragraphs, breaks and lists. The semantic markup is meant to helo emphasize information in the document. Such as bold, quotes, or strike throughs.
