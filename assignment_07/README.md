1. An id is an identification label that is used to identify a specific element. A class is what groups similar types of elements together using the same name value. A div is what groups elements together in a block style. A span is what identifys or groups content together that has styling or organization.
2. Alt text is used to describe an image without it showing up. It is used mainly for the visually impaired.
3. The work cycle for this assignment was a bit more challenging for me. I kept messing up adding in the video and audio. There was a lot more involved with this assignment. Overall I enjoyed the material involved.
