        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
<pre>We fight we get high holding on to love
We came down 'cause there was nothing holding us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend
'Cause nobody's calling
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So darling
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing
I look around as my heart is collapsing
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me
We wrote and we wrote
Til there were no more words
We laughed and we cried
Until we saw our worst
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend
'Cause nobody's calling
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
Will someone
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancing
I look around as my heart is collapsing
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me
Last night I lay awake
Stuck on the things we say
And when I close my eyes the first thing I hear you say is
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing
I look around and you're standing there asking
You say, you're the only one I need
So put your love on me
You're the only one I need
Put your love on me</pre>
