### Final Project


1. I can't say I've learned anything new on the web development side of this class, but was more refreshed on how everthing worked.
2. I learned on the web design portion how to link the navigation bar to different sites. It took me a few tries to get it working properly but when I did it went smoothly.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was challenging but a great learning experience. Not having a video to follow along with made it difficult but using the website to help with the things I struggled with worked out fine. By the end of it I felt more confident in my ablilties to design a website and understand what goes into it.
