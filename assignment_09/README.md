1. The difference between the universal, element, class and id selector types is, universal styles every element on the page, element selects all of one certain type of elemets, class is used to select elements that work as the same function, and id let's developers define style rules for specific elements.
2. The color palette I chose is composed of brown, red orange, yellow, and blue. It was the common color palette in the 70's. The hex codes are, brown - #6d8206, red - #d63606, yellow - #f3e51f, orange - #f39f1f, and blue -  #0000a0.
3. The work cycle for this assignment was fun for me. I enjoyed creating a 70's themed page. I wanted to put a colored background behind the pictures, but couldnt figure out how to make it work so I stuck with the headers having a background. Other than that everything else was understandable and easy to apply.
