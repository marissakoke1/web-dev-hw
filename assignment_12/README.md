# Assignment 12

  1. My client was someone who was opening a dog adoption place. They wanted it to
  look bright and welcoming when people visited the page. They enjoy pastel colors
  so that's where the color pallet came from.
  2. The difference between display block, inline and inline-block is, display block is used to create vertical naviagtional bars, display inline makes elements act like inline elements to only take up as much space as needed and display inline-block takes away new lines in block elements and have certian spacing and a set width.
  3. This assignment was probably the hardest assignment for me. At first I couldn't find the first 1-9 videos so that made it challenging for me. Once I found the other nine videos I was able to do the assignment decently. I really like the color pallet in this just because it's so bright and happy. I liked making the button. Other than that I enjoyed the long process of making this website.
