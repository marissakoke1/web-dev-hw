<pre>I have heard so many people
say the same thing,
do the same thing,
over and over
that I was beginning to do
and say the same things myself

People will do that to you.
Most become what they hear
and see.

You have to really
know yourself not to follow
the crowd,
and you have to really
know the crowd to find yourself.

The world is filled
with these kinds of people.

The world needs more of you

and less of them.</pre>
