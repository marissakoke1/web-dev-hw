# Assignment 2
## Marissa Koke


I decided to take this class because I wanted to get a better understanding of web design and it is one of the electives that sounded more interesting to me.

Three things i've learned:
1. How to put an absolute link and a photo into atom using square brakets and parentheses.
2. The relationship between a IP adress and DNS.
3. I hope to learn more about building a website for future purposes.
