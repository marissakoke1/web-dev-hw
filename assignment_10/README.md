1. The difference between system font, web font and web safe font is, a system font is already installed into your computer, a web font is a font that isn't already in your computer and has to have certain elements to work properly, and a web safe font is one that is used by both Windows and Mac and it reduces load time.
2. The importance of having fallback fonts is so if you miss spell or your computer doesn't have the required font it will default to what is available in that font category.
3. I really enjoyed doing this project. The only difficult thing was the allignment of the text. It wasn't working out how I wanted it to so I left it to what it would let me do.
